## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **data-driven decision making** through **A/B Testing** in the context of mobile gaming analytics.  
A synthetic experiment dataset was designed to evaluate the impact of a newly introduced game feature on **user engagement and monetization metrics**.

The analysis simulates real-world gameplay behavior by comparing a **control group** against a **test group**, measuring changes in session duration, user retention, and in-app purchases using **statistical hypothesis testing**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To apply core **data science, statistics, and experimentation principles** by:

- Evaluating group-wise user engagement performance
- Visualizing behavioral patterns across cohorts
- Performing rigorous statistical hypothesis tests
- Deriving actionable product insights from data

---

## 🧪 Experimental Design & Dataset

A synthetic dataset was generated to emulate realistic mobile game user behavior with the following attributes:

- `user_id` – Unique player identifier  
- `group` – Experiment group (`control` / `test`)  
- `session_duration` – Average gameplay session duration (minutes)  
- `retention` – Binary indicator (1 = returned user, 0 = churned)  
- `in_app_purchases` – Total in-game spending (USD)  

---

## 📊 Statistical Analysis Pipeline

### 🔍 Descriptive & Exploratory Analysis
- Summary statistics to compare central tendencies and dispersion
- Distribution analysis of session duration and spending behavior

### 📈 Data Visualization
- **Boxplots** for session duration comparison
- **Bar charts** for retention and purchase rate analysis
- Visual validation of experiment assumptions

### 🧠 Hypothesis Testing
- **Independent T-Test** – Mean session duration comparison  
- **Chi-Square Test** – Retention rate significance  
- **Mann–Whitney U Test** – Non-parametric spending comparison  

---

## 📈 Results Summary

- **Session Duration:** Statistically significant increase in the test group  
- **Retention Rate:** Improved user retention with strong statistical confidence  
- **In-App Purchases:** Higher average spending observed in the test group  

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The experimental results indicate that the newly introduced game feature **positively impacts user engagement and monetization**.  
Findings support **broader feature rollout**, with recommendations for continued experimentation and long-term monitoring.
